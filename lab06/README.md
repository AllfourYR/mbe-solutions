# Lab6B
This level consists in a RCE exploit. The explanation inside the exploit code is a bit vague. This is because I was very  
tired at the time of writing the exploit and I didn't want to spend too much time explaining all the things. I think that  
if you have reverse engineered the binary and you understand how the hash algorithm works, the little explanaition I've  
written should be enough to understand the whole process (if that is not the case you can contact me via email to discuss  
this level).  

# Lab6C  
This level requires bruteforcing a single nibble. This means that it has a chance of working in 1/16 runs. The exploit  
shouln't take too long to retreive the flag.
